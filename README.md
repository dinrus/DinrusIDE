U++ Windows Installation
Windows release is a simple archive .7z archive. Unpack to directory of your
preference, then just run theide.exe.

U++ does not write anything to registry or outside its directory.

The archive contains CLANG based Win32 toolchain and also SDL 2, OpenSSL, MySql
and PostgreSQL client libraries. TheIDE will also setup Microsoft C++ compiler
if it finds one.
	
U++ minimum requirement is Windows 7 64 with latest patches for theide to run
and Windows 7 64 or 32 with latest patches for compiled applications.
